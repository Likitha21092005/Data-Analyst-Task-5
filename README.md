Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Titanic Dataset: 

Project Overview:  
This project conducts an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, leveraging Python’s powerful libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn) to uncover key patterns, trends, and relationships. The goal is to analyze passenger demographics, survival rates, and the influence of different features on survival.

Dataset: 
The Titanic dataset contains records of 891 passengers, including:  
- Demographics (Age, Sex)  
- Socioeconomic status (Passenger Class)  
- Travel details (Fare, Embarked)  
- Survival status (Survived or Not Survived)  

Tools & Libraries:
- Python 3.x 
- Pandas (Data Manipulation)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)  
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code (Interactive Analysis)  

Project Structure: 
- titanic_eda.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook with full analysis, visualizations, and insights.  
- Titanic_EDA.pdf – Exported report for quick review.  
- (Optional) Additional supporting files (e.g., raw dataset, cleaned data).  

How to Run:  
1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Open titanic_eda.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.  
3. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis.  
4. Alternatively, check Titanic_EDA.pdf for a summarized report.  

Key Findings:  
Demographics: 
Majority of passengers were male (64.8%) and 3rd class (55.1%).  
Age distribution skewed toward younger passengers (20-40 years).  

Survival Insights:  
Females had a significantly higher survival rate (74.2%)vs. males (18.9%).  
1st-class passengers had the highest survival rate (62.9%), while 3rd class had the lowest (24.2%).  

Missing Data: 
Age (19.9%), Cabin (77.1%), Embarked (0.2%) contained missing values.  

Key Factors Influencing Survival:  
Passenger class, sex, and fare were strongly correlated with survival.  
Families (SibSp & Parch)had mixed survival trends.  

Future Work:
Predictive modeling(Logistic Regression, Random Forest).  
Feature engineering (Age grouping, Fare bins).  
Handling missing data(Imputation strategies).  


Improvements Over Original:
✅ More structured & professional formatting. 
✅ Clearer bullet points for better readability.  
✅ Added "Future Work" section for scalability. 
✅ More precise survival rate statistics.
✅ Better flow from overview to findings.
